      <p>I put this skeleton together to show how clojure could be used in the server side parts of 3601 classes. </p>
      <p>it's pretty barebones, but it should show how it all could fit together.</p>
      <p>The following adddresses should do something, and more will be added </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <p>
            "/" should take you to the homepage
          </p></li>
          <li> <p>
            "/echo/something" should display something back at you
          </p></li>
          <li> <p>
            "/faculty" should display a somewhat broken test page
          </p></li>
          <li> <p>
            "/help" should get you here.
          </p></li>
